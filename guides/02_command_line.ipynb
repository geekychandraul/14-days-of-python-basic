    "### 🐣 Common Beginner Mistakes at the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things that trip up almost everyone in the beginning — and that’s totally okay!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Forgetting to `cd` into the right directory**\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you’re in the correct folder before running commands.\n",
    "👉 Use `pwd` (Print Working Directory) to check where you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Confusing `rm` and `mv`**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rm` deletes files **permanently**\n",
    "* `mv` moves or renames them\n",
    "  ❗️There’s no undo button for `rm`, so use it carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Not using tab completion**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can press `Tab` while typing a filename or folder name — the terminal will auto-complete it for you.\n",
    "✅ Saves time and avoids typos!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Using the wrong slashes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **forward slashes `/`** on Mac/Linux\n",
    "* Use **backslashes `\\`** on Windows CMD\n",
    "* But on **PowerShell and Git Bash**, forward slashes often work too.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Mixing up file paths**\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative vs absolute paths can be confusing at first.\n",
    "🧭 Tip: `.` means “current directory” and `..` means “one level up”."

    "With a little curiosity and practice, the command line will quickly start to feel like second nature."
