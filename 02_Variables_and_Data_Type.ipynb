    "## 👋 Welcome Back!\n",
    "Yesterday, we learned how to shout at the screen using `print()`.\n",
    "But there was a problem: **Python had the memory of a goldfish.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We could calculate `5 + 5`, but we couldn't *save* that result to use later.\n",

    "Imagine you are moving houses. You have a lot of stuff. You put your stuff in boxes and, most importantly, **you label the boxes**.\n",
    "* You don't look for \"that weird heavy metal thing.\"\n",
    "* You look for the box labeled **\"Kitchen Utils\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is just a **Label** for a piece of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to create one:\n",
    "`variable_name = value`\n",
    "* The `=` sign is not \"Equals\" like in math.\n",
    "* It means **\"Assign\"**. We are putting the value inside the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Equals\" Sign Trap:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Trap**: Students read x = x + 1 and their brain explodes because mathematically, $x$ cannot equal $x + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Fix**: Explicitly know that = means ASSIGNMENT, not equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: The = sign is a bossy commander. It says 'Take the thing on the right, and shove it into the box on the left.' It is an action, not a question.\n"
